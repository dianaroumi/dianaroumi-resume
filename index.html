        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">After graduating high school I began attending UCR. I am currently a second year student at the University of California Riverside. I am currently studying political science and plan to attend law school after my graduation year, 2024. Essentially I plan to become a criminal justice lawyer. I have some background in psych, being a previous psych major, which gives me an upper hand. I am possibly considering a minor in sociology which would greatly benefit my future law career. I have had a total of three jobs since being of age to work. My first job was at a Kumon tutoring center, in my hometown. There I tutored young students from the ages of four to ten in math and reading. I worked with these students helping learn things such as addition, subtraction, writing, reading, spelling, division, multiplication, etc. I saw great progress in the students that I tutored. Working at Kumon I also graded papers and interacted with parents, notifying them of their childrenâ€™s progress. In highschool I also babysat for a couple families in my free time. I have extensive work with children. After my job at Kumon, I began working at LA Fitness, a well known gym in the United States, as a front desk receptionist. There I greeted guests coming in to work out, answered phones and questions of members, helped individuals with their membership plans, and sometimes helped to clean the gym equipment. This was only one of my jobs working in customer service. I now work as a cashier at the franchise Nothing Bundt Cakes. Although I do not bake or frost cakes, I interact with customers, answering all their questions, pull orders from the back fridge, take orders, answer phones, work the cash register, count the money at the end of each work day, and help with cleaning duties. These cleaning duties include mopping and sweeping the floors, taking out the trash, using windex on all mirrors and glass doors, and helping the ctrafters finish up their closing tasks as well. Working customer service has truly taught me how to deal with frustrated customers and siarm those who may be angry. For example, a couple of weeks ago I had a customer who entered the store in a rage. She was upset that her order was not completed on time, as she was already late for work. Rather than fight back with her, I apologized a countless number of times, asked the bakers in the back to rush her order, and offered her a free personalized mini cake for the inconvenience. I had completely disarmed her by the time that she was leaving the store. Situations and individuals such as this woman have taught me the importance of reasoning with people, which I think will work to benefit me in my future endeavors and law career. I plan to continue to continue to work at this job and always put my best foot forward. I am both excited and apprehensive about what the future holds.<br><br>
